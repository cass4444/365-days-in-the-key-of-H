Hey there beautiful people. ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks for checking out this passion project of mine, where I'll basically go on tangents about things I find interesting. Music, Philosophy, Language, whatever. 

It might not really be informative or entertaining, but if you like to take a look at a stranger's impromptu thoughts, feel free~
